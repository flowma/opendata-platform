 * The implementation of the box entry remote service.

 * Never reference this interface directly. Always use {@link org.opencities.berlin.opendata.entity.service.BoxEntryServiceUtil} to access the box entry remote service.

 *
 * <p>
 * This is a remote service. Methods of this service are expected to have security checks based on the propagated JAAS credentials because this service can be accessed remotely.
